- **Regularization**: Constraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter**: is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the model). As such, it is not affected by the learning algorithm itself; it must be set prior to training and remains constant during training.
- **Generalization error**/**out-of-sample error**: The error rate on new cases.
